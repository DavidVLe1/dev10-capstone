## Problem Statement
- In the realm of gaming, timeless classics like Mega Man have left an 
    indelible mark on the hearts of players across generations. Nevertheless, 
    the gaming landscape lacks accessible titles within the beloved platformer 
    shooter genre that pay homage to the nostalgia and thrill of those legendary 
    titles of yesteryear. This presents a compelling opportunity to craft a simple 
    platformer shooter game, evoking a sense of nostalgia while offering a fresh and 
    engaging gaming experience for the masses. 

## Technical Solution:
- The game is designed to provide players with responsive controls, formidable 
    adversaries, and an immersive world that calls back to the essence of what made 
    Mega Man an unforgettable adventure while also being accessible in the form
    of a web-based game. In essence, this game meets the demand 
    for an approachable yet exhilarating platformer shooter that resonates with
    both long-time enthusiasts and newcomers to this cherished genre.

-   Build a web game app using either phaser.js or Kaboom.js. 
    backend can handle stuff like user,Profile, GameData, stats, items, 
    maybes( enemies,npcs, Leaderboards, game events, achievements) that can be their own separate tables.
